# 📊 Campus Placement Analysis using Python

In this project i have done data analysis of campus placement records using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The dataset includes company names, number of students placed, total packages offered, and placement time.

The goal is to extract meaningful insights about placement trends and company behavior.
